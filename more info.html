    <p>If you get 50 credits with Merits or Excellences, you will receive Certificate Endorsement, which lets everyone know how well you did, and you will also have Merit or Excellence added to your NCEA certification. A course endorsement let's people know that you are particularly skilled in that area or course. You will receive an Excellence endorsement for a course if you receive 14 credits with Excellence in it, such as in math or music. 
        </p>
    <p>Make sure the standards you are studying are going to give you the results you need so you can do what you want to do when you leave school. And make sure you are achieving the most excellent results possible, including the most Excellence and Merits. You may apply to an international university because NCEA is recognised internationally.</p>
