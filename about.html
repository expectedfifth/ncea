        <p>NCEA stands for National Certificate of Educational Achievement and It has 3 stages 1, 2 and 3. This is different to previous years as there are no learning recognition credits available for 2023.
            In Level 1 you need to get 80 credits from your internal and external assessments to get your certificate.
            Your subjects offer you enough credits to pass with some to spare. In level 2 you are aiming to achieve UE literacy. 5 reading and 5 writing credits as well as your Level 2 certificate. If you don’t achieve UE literacy in year 12, you can still get it in Level 3.</p>
            <p>When you get your results, you’ll know how many credits you’ve got. N, A, M, E and they stand for Not Achieved, Achieved, Merit, and Excellence.  You can probably guess what Not Achieved means … Achieved, Merit and Excellence tell you how well you did in reaching the standard
